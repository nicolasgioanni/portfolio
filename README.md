## Quick Setup

1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Check your installation by running:

    ```bash
    node -v
    ```

2. In the project directory, install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in the browser.

5. Customize the template by navigating to the `/src/components` directory. Modify texts, pictures, and other information as needed.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

If you are interested in creating a mockup image like the ones from the personal projects section, I recommend [Genmoo](https://gemoo.com/tools/browser-mockup-generator/). This website lets you generate sleek looking browser mockups for free.
